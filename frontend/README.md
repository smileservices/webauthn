Using ReactJS mini-apps with custom .css

## Frontend Scrips
We are using webpack to pack .js files and .scss files into bundles. The setting for webpack is in `/webpack.config.js`

To install:
- install deps: `npm install`

To build .js bundles:
- for development `npm run dev`
- for production `npm run prod`

To build main.css bundle: 
- both dev/production `npm run css`
